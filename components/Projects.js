              In late 2022, I embarked on a period of skill enhancement, which
              led to diverse project experiences. I{"'"}ve created engaging
              mobile games, delved into database architecture and design. My
              portfolio showcases my versatility and experience as a web
              developer. Examples of my work span game development, database
              architecture, and web design.
