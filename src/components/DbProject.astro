      Background & Purpose
    </h1>
    <p class="font-normal text-lg text-gray-700 mb-20">
      Initiated a personal project tailored for learning SQL and mastering
      database architecture, employing a Kaggle dataset as a sample context. The
      goal was to leverage SQL skills in designing a robust database structure.
      This hands-on experience not only deepened my understanding of SQL but
      also provided practical insights into effective database management using
      a real-world dataset sourced from Kaggle.

          complex data relationships in line with our project's objectives.
          Throughout this procedure, I meticulously fashioned several tables,
          specifying their types and defining their structure. Example of an

          As part of the project's data analysis phase, I combined multiple
          datasets and wrote SQL queries to extract and present pertinent
          information about anime studios and their production output. This
          process involved merging datasets, establishing relationships between
          tables, and crafting SQL queries to generate valuable insights. The
          result was a comprehensive view of the anime industry, showcasing the
          various studios and their respective contributions, as visualized
          through a bar graph. This allowed us to identify key players in the
          field and gain a deeper understanding of their production histories.

          Building upon the foundation of the combined and queried datasets, I
          expanded the analysis to investigate the annual production trends in
          the anime industry. To do this, I first needed to clean the data by
          removing null values and ensuring a robust dataset for the analysis.
          Subsequently, I crafted SQL queries to group and count the number of
          anime productions by year. This allowed us to determine which year
          witnessed the highest production volume, providing valuable insights
          into the industry's temporal dynamics. The data cleaning step was
          pivotal in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the findings.

          As part of our comprehensive analysis, I also sought to understand the
          relationship between the number of anime productions by each studio
          and the average popularity of their work. To achieve this, I
          meticulously computed the average popularity rating for each anime,
          connecting this metric to the studio responsible for its creation.
          This allowed me to discern which studio, regardless of the number of
          animes they produced, consistently excelled in generating the most
          popular works in terms of audience reception. <p class="mt-5">The utilization of
          z-scores in this analysis was paramount for several reasons. Firstly,
          it standardized both the number of anime produced and the popularity
          ratings, enabling fair comparisons between studios. This is
          particularly important when studios vary significantly in their
          production output or when dealing with different rating scales for
          popularity. Additionally, z-scores allowed me to identify studios that
          outperformed or underperformed relative to the overall dataset,
          providing a robust statistical basis for our findings and ensuring the
          integrity of our analysis.</p>

          The pie chart titled "Anime Distribution by Genre" provides a visual
          representation of the number of anime produced across different
          genres. It offers a concise overview of how the anime industry is
          distributed among various genres, helping us understand the popularity
          of different anime themes. Most Popular Genre: The genre with the
          largest segment indicates the most popular genre of anime, as it has
          the highest count of anime productions. Less Common Genres: Smaller
          segments reveal less common genres, indicating the variety within the
          anime industry. Genre Diversity: The pie chart illustrates the
          diversity and richness of anime, as it spans a wide range of genres,

                A significant observation from the chart is that many of the genres are
                classified as "Mature Themes," and they collectively represent a
                substantial portion of the anime produced. This suggests that mature and
                thought-provoking themes are prevalent in the anime industry, and numerous
                anime productions explore these complex and adult-oriented narratives.
                While some genres cater to younger audiences and family-friendly themes,
                the diversity of mature themes highlights the depth and sophistication of
                storytelling within the world of anime.

            uncategorized or unclassified anime productions in addition to the genres
            displayed in the chart.
