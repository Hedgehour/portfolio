      Background & Purpose
    </h1>
    <p class="font-normal text-lg text-gray-700 mb-20">
      The purpose of this project was to create a personal portfolio website to
      showcase my skills and progress as a novice developer. This website will
      serve as a platform to demonstrate my technical abilities and projects I
      have completed, as well as provide information about me. As technology
      continues to play a significant role in many industries, it is important
      for me to showcase my skills and abilities in programming and my aptitude
      for learning new skills. A personal portfolio website is a perfect way to
      do this, as it provides a centralized location to highlight my technical
      projects and relevant information about myself. Additionally, building a
      portfolio website from scratch will provide me with the opportunity to
      learn and apply various programming concepts, tools, and frameworks. The
      final product will serve as a tangible representation of my growth as a
      developer and a tool for future job opportunities.

          (e.g., HedgeHour).

          In this personal project, I took an agile/scrum approach to creating
          my personal portfolio website as a demonstration of my ability to work
          within a team in a real business setting and apply project management
          principles. By following this method, I aimed to showcase my
          understanding of agile principles, my ability to work collaboratively
          towards a common goal, and my understanding of project management
          concepts such as scope definition, planning, risk management, etc.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-10">
          Throughout the project, I applied the key elements of agile, such as
          daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and sprint retrospectives, as well
          as project management techniques such as risk identification and
          mitigation, project documentation, and progress reporting to ensure
          that the website was developed efficiently and effectively. The result
          was a comprehensive personal portfolio website that demonstrates not
          only my technical skills, but also my ability to work in an agile
          environment and deliver high-quality results within a structured
          project management framework.
